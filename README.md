# analyse_data


Drop files you'd like to analyse into a source directory, 
specify the prefix of the file where you'd like to lookup values in, 
specify the name of the column in the file - and the column name from your secondary files from where you're looking up values from.

Outputs a data validation boolean based on the number of lookups from your secondary files VS your main file.

**Work in progress** there will be a Django app built on top of this program in a user friendly UI :)
